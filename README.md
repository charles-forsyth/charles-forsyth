# Charles "Chuck" Forsyth ⚓🏛️🌲

### Director of Research Computing & Architect of Agentic Ecosystems
**AI Systems Architect | Autonomous Agents | LLM Orchestration | Strategic Leader**

I build the digital nervous systems that power modern research. My career operates at the bleeding edge where **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** converges with **Autonomous AI Agents** and **Generative AI**. I specialize in designing self-correcting, multi-agent systems that solve enterprise-scale problems.

## 🏛️ Professional Stature

As the **Director of Research Computing at UC Riverside** and former **Chairman of the UC Research IT Committee**, I define the strategy for next-generation research infrastructure. I bridge the gap between institutional leadership and the frontier of **Artificial Intelligence**.

### 🔮 Directed Agentic Engineering (DAE)
I am the pioneer of **Agentic DevOps**—a methodology for orchestrating squads of specialized AI agents to autonomously design, build, test, and release software.
*   **The Mission:** Replacing manual coding with **AI-Driven Engineering**.
*   **The Tool:** [squad-manager](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/squad-manager) — My flagship system for orchestrating autonomous developer squads.

## 🌟 Flagship AI Innovations

| Project | The Innovation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[squad-manager](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/squad-manager)** | **The Autonomous Agency.** A recursive **Multi-Agent System** that deploys specialized AI squads to build, test, and ship software from a single prompt. *It built its own code and documentation.* |
| **[uma (Ursa Major Ask)](https://github.com/UCR-Research-Computing/uma)** | **The Visionary Precursor.** Built years before the mainstream AI CLI explosion, `uma` was a pioneering attempt to integrate LLMs directly into the Linux shell. It allowed researchers to control their environment and query HPC systems using natural language. |
| **[agent_social_network](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/agent_social_network)** | **Emergent AI Behavior.** A simulator for **Computational Social Science** where autonomous personas debate, form persistent memories, and evolve. A study in **LLM Cognitive Architectures**. |
| **[UCR-HPC-Job-Gallery](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/UCR-HPC-Job-Gallery)** | **Automated Science.** A knowledge base of 55+ verified HPC workflows, transforming raw scripts into "Standard Model" scientific knowledge via **Automated Knowledge Engineering**. |
| **[deep-research](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/deep-research)** | **Autonomous Research Agent.** A production-grade AI analyst that conducts recursive, multi-step research and synthesizes complex data streams in real-time. |
