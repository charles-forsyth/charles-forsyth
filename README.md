# Hi there, I'm Charles Forsyth 👋

### 🏛️ Director of Research Computing & Architect of Agentic Systems

I build the digital nervous systems that power modern research. My work exists at the bleeding edge where **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** meets **Autonomous AI Agents**.

I don't just write code; I design **Self-Correcting Ecosystems**.

### 🔮 The Vision: "The Skywalker Workflow"

I believe the future of engineering is **Agentic DevOps**. I have pioneered a development methodology where human architects direct squads of specialized AI agents (Architects, Grunts, Gatekeepers) to build, test, and release software autonomously.

*   **Philosophy:** "Do or do not. There is no try." (Code must be perfect before commit).
*   **Method:** Strict architectural design, automated "Gauntlet" testing, and security auditing by adversarial AI.

### 🚀 Capabilities & Featured Innovations

#### 🧠 Autonomous Research & Intelligence
*   **[deep-research](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/deep-research)**: *The Analyst.* A production-ready CLI that turns Google's Gemini into an autonomous researcher. It doesn't just search; it reads files, synthesizes complex topics, and streams its "thinking process" live.
*   **[nexus](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/nexus)** *(Private)*: *The Central Nervous System.* A "Cyborg" CLI that manages the entire UCR Research Computing fleet. It links Researcher Identity (CRM) with Cloud Resources (UMI) and Funding Data (Grants), enabling proactive support rather than reactive tickets.
*   **[SwarmCLI](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/SwarmCLI)**: *The Hive Mind.* An experimental framework where multiple AI personas (The Skeptic, The Optimist, The Data Scientist) debate topics to reach a consensus, simulating a human boardroom.

#### 🎨 Generative Synthesis (Audio/Video/Code)
*   **[generate-tts](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/generate-tts)**: *The Podcaster.* Leverages Gemini's advanced native audio capabilities to generate multi-speaker "Deep Dive" podcasts and expressive summaries from static text files.
*   **[generate-music](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/generate-music)**: *The Composer.* Real-time AI music generation using Google's Vertex AI Lyria model, capable of creating adaptive soundtracks for workflows.
*   **[generate-veo-video](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/generate-veo-video)**: *The Director.* A CLI interface for Google's Veo 3.1, enabling text-to-video prototyping and morphing.

#### 🛡️ Infrastructure Compliance & Security
*   **[Skywalker](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/Skywalker)**: *The Auditor.* An automated compliance engine for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It scans the entire fleet for "Ursa Major" security violations, ensuring research data remains secure without hindering science.
*   **[ursa-dsp](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/ursa-dsp)**: *The Lawyer.* A tool for managing Data Security Plans (DSP) in regulated environments (HIPAA/CUI), transforming bureaucratic requirements into code-enforced policies.

#### 🔧 Simulations & Experimental Systems
*   **[q-ai-link](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/q-ai-link)**: *The Learner.* A Reinforcement Learning experiment where an AI agent learns to navigate a hazardous RPG world from scratch using Q-Learning.
*   **[mirage](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/mirage)**: *The Atmosphere.* A procedural generator for ambient experiences, blending visuals and sound to create digital environments.
*   **[tax-commander](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/tax-commander)**: *The Bureaucrat.* A custom-built, audit-proof system for municipal tax collection, proving that even government bureaucracy can be modernized with Python.
