# Charles "Chuck" Forsyth ⚓🏛️🌲

### Director of Research Computing & Architect of Agentic Ecosystems
**U.S. Navy Veteran | Strategic Leader | AI Toolsmith**

I build the digital nervous systems that power modern research. My career is a journey from troubleshooting radar systems on the **USS Lake Champlain** to architecting petabyte-scale cloud infrastructure for the **University of California**. I operate at the bleeding edge where **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, **Cloud Compliance**, and **Autonomous AI Agents** converge.

## 🏛️ Professional Stature

As the **Director of Research Computing at UC Riverside** and former **Chairman of the UC Research IT Committee**, I orchestrate the collective efforts of elite technology professionals to advance the research landscape across the entire UC system. I specialize in bridging the gap between high-level institutional strategy and hands-on technical execution.

### 🔮 The "Skywalker Workflow"
I am a pioneer of **Agentic DevOps**. I have developed a professional methodology where human architects direct squads of specialized AI agents to build, test, and release production-grade software autonomously.
*   **The Mission:** "Do or do not. There is no try." (Engineering excellence via absolute automation).
*   **The Tool:** [squad-manager](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/squad-manager) — My flagship system that orchestrates these autonomous teams.

## 🌟 Flagship Innovations

| Project | The Innovation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[squad-manager](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/squad-manager)** | **The Autonomous Agency.** A recursive Gemini skill that deploys specialized AI squads to build, test, and ship software from a single prompt. *It built its own code and documentation.* |
| **[agent_social_network](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/agent_social_network)** | **The AI Social Ecosystem.** A TUI-based simulator where autonomous personas debate, form persistent memories, and evolve. A study in emergent agentic behavior. |
| **[UCR-HPC-Job-Gallery](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/UCR-HPC-Job-Gallery)** | **Automated Science.** A self-generating knowledge base of 55+ verified Slurm workflows, transforming raw scripts into "Standard Model" scientific knowledge. |
| **[deep-research](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/deep-research)** | **The Autonomous Analyst.** A CLI that enables Gemini to conduct recursive, multi-step research, synthesizing complex data streams in real-time. |
| **[Skywalker](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/Skywalker)** | **The Fleet Auditor.** An automated compliance engine for Google Cloud, ensuring security and efficiency across large-scale research infrastructure. |
| **[nexus](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/nexus)** | **The Cyborg CNS.** *(Private)* The central nervous system for UCR Research Computing, linking Researcher ID, Cloud Resources, and Grant data for proactive support. |

## 🌲 Beyond the Command Line

I believe in a life balanced between high-stakes technology and the grounding of the natural world.

*   **Camp Tioga:** I reside at "Camp Tioga" in Pennsylvania, where I manage a diverse portfolio of assets with the same data-driven rigor I apply to the data center.
*   **The Outdoors:** I am an avid kayaker (Future Beach Angler 144) and sailor (Skipper of the *Arcturus*, an O'Day 27).
*   **Geocaching:** Active as **ClanForsyth** since 2012—finding logic and order in the physical world.
*   **Philosophy:** A student of strategic thinking (Peter Drucker) and a practitioner of earth-based spirituality. I appreciate the poetic theology of Malcolm Guite.
*   **Family:** Proudly supported by my wife, Laylla, our family, and our three cats: Milo, Gandalf, and Mable.
