# Charles "Chuck" Forsyth ⚓🏛️🌲

### Director of Research Computing & Architect of Agentic Ecosystems
**AI Systems Architect | Autonomous Agents | LLM Orchestration | Strategic Leader**

I build the digital nervous systems that power modern research. My career operates at the bleeding edge where **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** converges with **Autonomous AI Agents** and **Generative AI**. I specialize in designing self-correcting, multi-agent systems that solve enterprise-scale problems.

## 🏛️ Professional Stature

As the **Director of Research Computing at UC Riverside** and former **Chairman of the UC Research IT Committee**, I define the strategy for next-generation research infrastructure. I bridge the gap between institutional leadership and the frontier of **Artificial Intelligence**.

### 🔮 Directed Agentic Engineering (DAE)
I am the pioneer of **Agentic DevOps**—a methodology for orchestrating squads of specialized AI agents to autonomously design, build, test, and release software.
*   **The Mission:** Replacing manual coding with **AI-Driven Engineering**.
*   **The Tool:** [squad-manager](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/squad-manager) — My flagship system for orchestrating autonomous developer squads.
