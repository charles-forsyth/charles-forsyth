# Hi there, I'm Charles Forsyth 👋

### 🏛️ Director of Research Computing & Architect of Agentic Systems

I build the digital nervous systems that power modern research. My work exists at the bleeding edge where **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** meets **Autonomous AI Agents**.

I don't just write code; I design **Self-Correcting Ecosystems**.

---

### 🔮 The Vision: "The Skywalker Workflow"

I believe the future of engineering is **Agentic DevOps**. I have pioneered a development methodology where human architects direct squads of specialized AI agents (Architects, Grunts, Gatekeepers) to build, test, and release software autonomously.

*   **Philosophy:** "Do or do not. There is no try." (Code must be perfect before commit).
*   **Method:** Strict architectural design, automated "Gauntlet" testing, and security auditing by adversarial AI.

### 🌟 Flagship Innovations

The core systems that define my architectural style.

| Project | The Innovation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[squad-manager](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/squad-manager)** | **The Autonomous Agency.** A recursive skill for Gemini CLI that deploys specialized AI squads. The "Director Mode" orchestrates a full team (Architect, Grunt, Sentinel, DevOps) to build, test, and ship complete applications from a single prompt. *It built itself.* |
| **[agent_social_network](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/agent_social_network)** | **The AI Social Ecosystem.** A TUI-based simulator where autonomous personas debate, form persistent memories, and evolve in real-time. Supports both local (Ollama) and cloud (Gemini) backends. |
| **[deep-research](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/deep-research)** | **The Autonomous Analyst.** A CLI that transforms Gemini into a recursive researcher. It doesn't just search; it reads files, synthesizes complex topics, and streams its "thinking process" live. |
| **[nexus](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/nexus)** | **The Cyborg CNS.** *(Private)* The central nervous system for UCR Research Computing. It links Researcher Identity (CRM) with Cloud Resources (UMI) and Grants, enabling proactive, data-driven support. |
| **[SwarmCLI](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/SwarmCLI)** | **The Hive Mind.** A multi-agent consensus engine where simulated personas (The Skeptic, The Optimist, The Data Scientist) debate topics to generate balanced, high-quality outputs. |
| **[Skywalker](https://github.com/charles-forsyth/Skywalker)** | **The Fleet Auditor.** An automated compliance engine for Google Cloud. It scans the entire infrastructure fleet for security violations, enforcing "Ursa Major" standards without slowing down science. |
